    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Amyia Sweets! We are a dedicated team of professionals passionate about baking. Since our founding in 2024, we have been committed to satisfying customers one baked good at a time.</p>

    <p>Amyia Sweets began in a cozy kitchen with the rich, warm scent of freshly baked cookies filling the air. Our founder, Amyia Evans, has always been passionate about baking, bringing comfort and sweetness to her family and friends through her creations. Working in healthcare, Amyia’s days were often long and demanding, yet baking was her creative outlet—a way to unwind and spread a little joy. Over time, her friends and coworkers kept asking, "Where can we buy these treats?" Realizing there was a genuine love for her baked goods, Amyia decided it was time to turn her hobby into something more.</p>
